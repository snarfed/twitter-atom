# Note that App Engine / Cloud Build's default pip cache is overly aggressive
# with GitHub dependency URLs like these. If I push a new commit to the branch
# in one of these URLs, Cloud Build still uses the old cached version.

# Use this to bust that cache: gcloud -q beta app deploy --no-cache ...
